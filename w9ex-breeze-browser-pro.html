Breeze Systems has announced the latest version of its image browsing and RAW conversion software in the shape of BreezeBrowser Pro v1.5. This update allows XMP support for maximum compatibility with Photoshop. Usage duration: 6 weeks. Why I switched: I broke my trusted Samsung S6 edge which I had been using for almost 2.5 years. It wasn't worth fixing it as it was facing a slow death anyway. So when it broke, I was left with two options. Either buy a stop gap phone until S9 releases without spending a lot of money on it. Or look for a great deal on a great phone somewhere. Enter the PH-1. I found this amazing deal at sprint.com (I was already on Sprint).

Right now I have access to an unlocked HTC 10 and an ATampT Galaxy s7 and decided to do a comparison. These are just my personal opinions. Speed - Feel the same to me for what I do.
